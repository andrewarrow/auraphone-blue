# rules

use https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/bluetooth and 
https://github.com/android/connectivity-samples
and make this package as realistic to android kotlin BLE as possible

# state

GATT Operation Serialization Tests (bluetooth_gatt_test.go:195-469):
  - TestBluetoothGatt_OperationSerialization - Verifies that concurrent writes are rejected
  - TestBluetoothGatt_ReadWriteSerialization - Verifies that reads block writes and vice versa
  - TestBluetoothGatt_MultipleReadsBlocked - Verifies that rapid-fire operations are properly
  serialized

  GetRemoteDevice() Tests (bluetooth_manager_test.go:99-203):
  - TestBluetoothAdapter_GetRemoteDevice_NeverReturnsNil - Verifies nil is NEVER returned
  - TestBluetoothAdapter_GetRemoteDevice_ConnectionFailsForInvalidDevice - Verifies connection fails
   gracefully
  - TestBluetoothAdapter_GetRemoteDevice_MultipleCallsSameDevice - Verifies consistency

  Property String Conversion Tests (bluetooth_advertiser_test.go:159-402):
  - TestBluetoothGattServer_PropertyStringConsistency - Verifies all property strings are correct
  - TestBluetoothGatt_PropertyParsing - Verifies properties are parsed correctly during service
  discovery
  - TestBluetoothGatt_WriteNoResponseProperty - Verifies write_no_response property works end-to-end

  ðŸ“‹ What Was NOT Changed (as noted in PLAN.md)

  These items were marked as "Nice to Have" and not critical:
  - Descriptor read/write operations (BluetoothGattDescriptor exists but no read/write methods)
  - requestMtu() support (MTU negotiation)
  - readRemoteRssi() support (real-time RSSI updates)

  These are acceptable omissions for a simulator that prioritizes realistic BLE behavior patterns
  over complete API coverage.

  ðŸŽ¯ The kotlin package is now rock solid!

  All critical Android BLE behaviors are now properly simulated:
  - âœ… Operation serialization prevents concurrent GATT operations (real Android limitation)
  - âœ… GetRemoteDevice() never returns nil (matches real Android API contract)
  - âœ… Property strings are consistent throughout the codebase
  - âœ… Comprehensive test coverage ensures these behaviors stay correct
