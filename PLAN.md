1. No Connection Interval Simulation - The Biggest Surprise üö®

  Current behavior:
  Your photo transfer code sends chunks as fast as possible:
  for i, chunk := range chunks {
      wire.NotifyCharacteristic(peerUUID, serviceUUID, charUUID, chunk)
      // These all fire instantly via Unix sockets
  }

  Real BLE behavior:
  - BLE connections have a connection interval (typically 30-50ms on iOS, configurable 7.5ms-4s)
  - You can only send data during connection events - one event per interval
  - Each event has a small window (typically 2-5ms) to exchange packets
  - During that window, you can send ~3-5 packets (depending on data length and radio timing)
  - If you miss the window, you wait for the next interval

  What will shock you:
  - Sending 100 photo chunks that takes ~100ms in simulator will take 3-5 seconds on real hardware
  - UpdateValue() (iOS) / NotifyCharacteristicChanged() (Android) will start returning false after
  the first 3-5 chunks when the TX buffer fills up
  - You'll need to implement flow control - wait for peripheralManagerIsReady(toUpdateSubscribers:)
  callback on iOS or retry on Android
  - With multiple connected devices, the radio is time-sliced between connections - 5 connections
  means each gets ~20% of bandwidth

  Missing from simulator:
  - wire/wire.go uses instant socket sends with no connection interval delays
  - No TX buffer depth limits (real iOS/Android buffer 1-5 packets max)
  - No peripheralManagerIsReady callback when buffer drains

  2. Service Discovery Caching Will Cause Mysterious Bugs üêõ

  Current behavior:
  // swift/cb_peripheral.go:74
  gattTable, err := p.wire.ReadGATTTable(p.remoteUUID)
  // Instant read from global registry, takes ~100ms with artificial delay

  Real BLE behavior:
  - First service discovery takes 500ms - 2 seconds (multiple ATT protocol round trips)
  - iOS aggressively caches the GATT table - sometimes across app restarts
  - Changing characteristics during development? iOS won't see the changes until:
    - Device is unpaired/forgotten
    - iOS Bluetooth cache is cleared (Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Reset ‚Üí Reset Network Settings)
    - Device sends a "Service Changed" indication (0x2A05 characteristic)
  - Android has similar caching plus infamous GATT 133 errors when cache corrupts

  What will shock you:
  - "Why is my iPhone not seeing the updated photo characteristic?" ‚Üí Cache
  - "It works on the first connection but not after reconnecting" ‚Üí Stale cache
  - "One phone works, the other doesn't" ‚Üí One has cached old GATT table

  Missing from simulator:
  - No service discovery round-trip simulation (ATT Read By Group Type, Read By Type, Find
  Information)
  - No persistent GATT cache across device restarts
  - No Service Changed characteristic (0x2A05) to invalidate cache

  3. Perfectly Reliable Message Delivery vs. Reality üìâ

  Current behavior:
  - Unix domain sockets provide TCP-like reliability - messages arrive in order, no loss (except the
   simulated 0.1%)
  - Length-prefixed framing ensures you never get partial messages
  - Notifications/writes succeed unless the simulated 0.1% packet loss triggers

  Real BLE behavior:
  - Notifications are fire-and-forget at the radio level - no ACK, no guaranteed delivery
  - If receiver's connection event is skipped (radio busy, interference), notification is silently 
  dropped
  - Write without response truly means "I sent it, good luck" - no confirmation
  - No flow control for notifications - if you send faster than receiver can process, packets are
  dropped
  - Connection events can be skipped during:
    - High radio interference (2.4GHz is crowded - WiFi, microwaves, other BLE devices)
    - Device is servicing another BLE connection
    - OS is doing background tasks (scan, connection to another device)

  What will shock you:
  - Photo chunks will go missing with no error reported
  - You'll need application-level ACKs - can't rely on notifications arriving
  - Current code assumes if NotifyCharacteristic() doesn't error, the chunk was delivered - WRONG on
   real BLE
  - Notification order isn't guaranteed across characteristics (though usually maintained within one
   characteristic)

  Missing from simulator:
  - Notification delivery confirmation (it's truly fire-and-forget, no way to know if it arrived)
  - Connection event skipping due to radio contention
  - Realistic buffer overflow behavior (simulator has unlimited Go channel buffering)

  Bonus: Radio Contention With Multiple Connections üìª

  Your mesh design connects to multiple peers simultaneously. Real BLE has ONE radio that
  time-slices between connections:

  - 1 connection: ~90% bandwidth available for your app
  - 3 connections: ~30% bandwidth each
  - 5 connections: ~18% bandwidth each (plus overhead)

  Photo transfer throughput will drop dramatically as you scale up the mesh. The simulator has
  independent Unix sockets with no shared resource contention.

  Recommendations

  1. Add connection interval simulation to wire/wire.go - rate-limit sends to ~20 packets/second per
   connection
  2. Implement flow control in photo transfer - wait for ACKs before sending next chunk batch
  3. Add sequence numbers to PhotoChunkMessage and implement retransmission
  4. Test with iOS Developer mode "Connection Interval" set to 100ms+ to see realistic timing
