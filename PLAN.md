# Plan: Fix 50% Photo Transfer Failure Rate

## Problem Analysis (Test Run 2025-10-27_10-14-10)

**Result**: 10/20 transfers succeeded (50% success rate)

**Previous run (2025-10-27_09-49-03)**: Also 10/20 (50%) - **SAME ISSUE PERSISTS**

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. **Chunks Sent But Never Received** (CRITICAL)
- **Evidence**: 187 `send_started` events but only 65 `receive_started` events
- **Symptoms**:
  - Sender logs: `send_started` + `chunk_sent` (all chunks)
  - Receiver logs: **NOTHING** (no `receive_started`, no `chunk_received`)
- **Impact**: ~65% of transfer attempts fail silently on receiver side

**Example failure:**
```
YMLA0QYO ‚Üí ASG1KC19:
  09:48:07 - photo_request_received [YMLA0QYO side]
  09:48:07 - send_started [YMLA0QYO side]
  09:48:07 - chunk_sent (x4) [YMLA0QYO side]
  [NO EVENTS ON ASG1KC19 SIDE] ‚ùå
```

**Possible causes:**
1. Photo chunks not reaching `HandlePhotoChunk()` on receiver
2. UUID ‚Üí DeviceID mapping failures causing early returns
3. Wire layer dropping messages silently
4. Wrong characteristic/socket being used for chunk delivery

#### 2. **Duplicate Photo Requests** (MAJOR)
- **Evidence**: ASG1KC19 ‚Üí TI05WNAZ shows 13+ `photo_request_received` events
- **Impact**: Senders restart transfers multiple times, potentially losing progress
- **Status**: MergeGossip fix IS implemented (prevents duplicate discoveries), but requests are still sent multiple times

**Why it's still happening:**
- Photo requests sent on every gossip interval (5 seconds)
- `PhotoRequestSent` flag not checked before sending requests
- Flag might be reset incorrectly somewhere

#### 3. **Uneven Device Participation** (MODERATE)
- **ASG1KC19** (F09FFFB7): Only 21 timeline events (vs 400-520 for others)
  - 1 send, 2 receive_started, 1 receive_complete
- **KXX18IL0** (E0D11F4F): Only 98 timeline events
  - 7 sends, 9 receive_started, 7 receive_complete

**Why**: These devices are not discovering/requesting photos properly

#### 4. **Connection Drops During Transfers** (MINOR)
- Only 6 socket errors total (very low impact)
- ASG1KC19 ‚Üî TI05WNAZ: Connection dropped at 09:48:07, reconnected 09:48:28
- May have interrupted 1-2 transfers

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnose Why Chunks Don't Reach Receiver (2-3 hours)

#### Step 1.1: Add Detailed Logging to Wire Layer
**File**: `wire/wire.go` (or iOS/Android write methods)

Add logging BEFORE and AFTER every chunk write:
```go
func (w *Wire) WriteCharacteristic(uuid, serviceUUID, charUUID string, data []byte) error {
    logger.Debug(w.hardwareUUID[:8], "üì§ WIRE WRITE: target=%s char=%s bytes=%d",
        uuid[:8], charUUID[:8], len(data))

    err := w.actualWriteToSocket(uuid, data)

    if err != nil {
        logger.Error(w.hardwareUUID[:8], "‚ùå WIRE WRITE FAILED: target=%s error=%v",
            uuid[:8], err)
    } else {
        logger.Debug(w.hardwareUUID[:8], "‚úÖ WIRE WRITE SUCCESS: target=%s", uuid[:8])
    }

    return err
}
```

#### Step 1.2: Add Logging to iOS/Android Receive Path
**Files**: `iphone/central_delegate.go`, `iphone/peripheral_delegate.go`, `android/gatt_callback.go`

Add logging IMMEDIATELY when data arrives:
```go
func (d *CentralDelegate) DidUpdateValueForCharacteristic(characteristic *swift.CBCharacteristic) {
    logger.Debug(d.iphone.hardwareUUID[:8],
        "üì• RECEIVED DATA: char=%s bytes=%d from_peripheral=%s",
        characteristic.UUID[:8], len(characteristic.Value), peripheral.UUID[:8])

    // Then decode and call HandlePhotoChunk...
}
```

#### Step 1.3: Run Test With Enhanced Logging
```bash
go run main.go --phones 5 --duration 60s --packet-loss 0.001

# Check logs for:
# 1. Do WIRE WRITE SUCCESS events exist for failed transfers?
# 2. Do RECEIVED DATA events exist on receiver side?
# 3. Where is the data being lost?
```

**Expected outcomes:**
- **If WIRE WRITE SUCCESS but no RECEIVED DATA**: Socket/connection issue
- **If RECEIVED DATA but no HandlePhotoChunk**: Decoding/routing issue
- **If HandlePhotoChunk called but no StartReceive**: UUID‚ÜíDeviceID mapping failure

#### Step 1.4: Check UUID ‚Üí DeviceID Mapping
**File**: `phone/photo_handler.go` line 130-165

The code already logs the entire UUID‚ÜíDeviceID map on every chunk. Check logs for:
```
üìã Current UUID‚ÜíDeviceID map has N entries:
   - UUID1 ‚Üí DeviceID1
   - UUID2 ‚Üí DeviceID2
```

**If map is empty or missing sender**: That's the bug! Receiver can't identify sender.

**Verify handshake completes:**
- Handshake should populate UUID‚ÜíDeviceID map
- Check if handshake happens BEFORE photo chunks are sent
- May need to wait for handshake before sending photo requests

---

### Phase 2: Fix Duplicate Photo Requests (1 hour)

#### Issue: Photo requests sent repeatedly despite PhotoRequestSent=true

**Find where photo requests are sent:**
```bash
grep -r "SendPhotoRequest\|photo_request_received" iphone/ android/ phone/
```

**Expected fix location**: Likely in gossip processing or connection establishment handler

**Fix**: Add guard before sending request:
```go
// Before sending photo request
device := meshView.GetDevice(deviceID)
if device.PhotoRequestSent {
    logger.Debug("‚è≠Ô∏è Skipping photo request to %s (already sent)", deviceID)
    return
}

// Send request...
meshView.MarkPhotoRequested(deviceID)
```

---

### Phase 3: Fix Uneven Participation (1 hour)

#### Issue: ASG1KC19 and KXX18IL0 barely participating

**Check gossip neighbors:**
```bash
# From gossip_audit.jsonl, check which devices are gossiping to whom
grep "gossip_sent\|gossip_received" ~/.auraphone-blue-data/*/gossip_audit.jsonl
```

**Verify neighbor selection:**
- Should have ~3 neighbors each
- ASG1KC19 might not be in anyone's neighbor list (due to SHA256 hash sorting)
- If isolated, increase `maxNeighbors` or use different neighbor selection

**Fix**: Ensure all devices have at least 2 neighbors
```go
// In mesh_view.go SelectRandomNeighbors()
// Add minimum neighbor guarantee
if len(neighbors) < 2 && len(mv.devices) >= 2 {
    // Force inclusion of at least 2 neighbors even if hash is high
}
```

---

### Phase 4: Handle Connection Drops Gracefully (30 min)

#### Current behavior: Transfers lost when connection drops

**Fix**: Pause transfers on disconnect, resume on reconnect

**File**: `phone/photo_transfer_coordinator.go`

```go
// Add methods:
func (c *PhotoTransferCoordinator) PauseTransfersForDevice(deviceID string) {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()

    if send, exists := c.inProgressSends[deviceID]; exists {
        send.Paused = true
        logger.Debug(c.hardwareUUID[:8], "‚è∏Ô∏è Paused send to %s", deviceID)
    }

    if recv, exists := c.inProgressReceives[deviceID]; exists {
        recv.Paused = true
        logger.Debug(c.hardwareUUID[:8], "‚è∏Ô∏è Paused receive from %s", deviceID)
    }
}

func (c *PhotoTransferCoordinator) ResumeTransfersForDevice(deviceID string) {
    // Resume and retry missing chunks
}
```

**Call from**: iOS/Android disconnect handlers

## Testing Plan

### Test 1: Enhanced Logging Test (diagnose)
```bash
go run main.go --phones 5 --duration 60s

# Check logs line-by-line to find where chunks are lost
# Focus on failed transfers from test report
```

### Test 2: After Fixes (validate)
```bash
# Run 5-phone test
go run main.go --phones 5 --duration 120s --packet-loss 0.001

# Expected: 20/20 transfers succeed (100%)
# Check test report
cat ~/.auraphone-blue-data/test_report_*.md
```

### Test 3: Stress Test (ensure reliability)
```bash
# Run with higher packet loss
go run main.go --phones 5 --duration 180s --packet-loss 0.05

# Should still achieve 90%+ success rate with retries
```

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Primary Goal: 100% success rate** (20/20 transfers)
- All `send_started` events matched by `receive_started` events
- No silent failures

‚úÖ **No duplicate photo requests**
- Each device‚Üídevice pair: exactly 1 `photo_request_received` event
- Unless photo hash changes (legitimate re-request)

‚úÖ **All devices participate equally**
- Each device should have 100-500 timeline events
- No device with <50 events

‚úÖ **Connection drops don't cause failures**
- Transfers resume after reconnection
- Missing chunks detected and re-requested

---

## Implementation Order

### Day 1: Investigation (3-4 hours)
1. üîÑ Add enhanced logging to wire layer (30 min) - IN PROGRESS
2. ‚è≥ Add logging to iOS/Android receive paths (30 min)
3. ‚è≥ Run test with logging and analyze (2 hours)
4. ‚è≥ Identify exact failure point (1 hour)

### Day 2: Fixes (3-4 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Fix root cause from investigation (varies)
2. ‚úÖ Fix duplicate photo requests (1 hour)
3. ‚úÖ Fix uneven participation (1 hour)
4. ‚úÖ Add connection drop handling (30 min)
5. ‚úÖ Run validation tests (1 hour)

**Total: 6-8 hours**

## Files to Modify

### Investigation Phase
- `wire/wire.go` - Add write logging
- `iphone/central_delegate.go` - Add receive logging
- `iphone/peripheral_delegate.go` - Add receive logging
- `android/gatt_callback.go` - Add receive logging

### Fix Phase (TBD based on investigation results)
Likely:
- `phone/photo_handler.go` - Fix UUID‚ÜíDeviceID handling
- `iphone/iphone.go` or `android/android.go` - Fix photo request logic
- `phone/mesh_view.go` - Fix neighbor selection
- `phone/photo_transfer_coordinator.go` - Add pause/resume

---

## Key Insights

1. **The old PLAN.md was wrong** - It assumed duplicate discovery was the main issue, but actually **chunks not reaching receivers** is the critical bug

2. **Tests pass but integration fails** - Unit tests verify individual components work, but the end-to-end flow has a delivery problem

3. **50% failure rate is suspiciously high** - Suggests a systematic issue, not random packet loss. Likely:
   - Photo requests sent before handshake completes (no UUID‚ÜíDeviceID mapping yet)
   - Or chunks sent to wrong socket/characteristic
   - Or receiver not subscribed to notifications properly

4. **Device F09FFFB7 (ASG1KC19) is the canary** - Only 21 events means it's barely working. If we fix its issues, we'll likely fix everything.

## Bug Found! (2025-10-27 Analysis)

### Root Cause
**Multiple devices are responding to photo requests intended for a single device.**

Example from logs:
- Device 0JSEUJO6 (B4698CEC) requests ZSJSMVL7's photo (hash 35a9a4ad)
- ZSJSMVL7 (12D90340) correctly responds with its 18777-byte photo ‚úÖ
- BUT: B4698CEC, F09FFFB7, and 88716210 ALSO respond with THEIR OWN photos ‚ùå
- Result: ZSJSMVL7 receives wrong photos from wrong devices

### Evidence from Logs
```
[B4698CEC iOS DEBUG] üì§ Sent photo request for 35a9a4ad
[B4698CEC iOS INFO ] üì∏ Sending our photo to ZSJSMVL7 (13964 bytes, 4 chunks)  ‚ùå WRONG!
[F09FFFB7 iOS INFO ] üì∏ Sending our photo to ZSJSMVL7 (15311 bytes, 4 chunks)  ‚ùå WRONG!
[88716210 iOS INFO ] üì∏ Sending our photo to ZSJSMVL7 (11138 bytes, 3 chunks)  ‚ùå WRONG!
```

Wire statistics:
- 327 photo chunks SENT
- 432 photo chunks RECEIVED (32% more!)
- Chunks ARE arriving, but wrong devices are sending

### Hypothesis
The `PhotoRequestMessage` is either:
1. Being broadcast to all devices instead of just the target
2. Has swapped requester/target fields
3. Handler logic incorrectly interprets who should respond

### Fix Applied
Added debug logging to `photo_handler.go:67-68` to log:
```go
logger.Debug(prefix, "üì© Photo request: from=%s requester=%s target=%s (we are %s)",
    senderUUID[:8], req.RequesterDeviceId[:8], req.TargetDeviceId[:8], device.GetDeviceID()[:8])
```

### Next Step
Run test again with new logging to see exact field values in PhotoRequestMessage.
