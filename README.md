# Auraphone Blue - Fake Bluetooth Simulator

A Go-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) simulator that uses filesystem-based message passing to simulate iOS and Android BLE communication without requiring real devices.

## Why This Exists

Testing real-world BLE edge cases is difficult:
- **Hardware Required:** Need multiple physical iOS and Android devices
- **Hard to Reproduce:** Edge cases like photo collision, stale handshakes, and connection race conditions are timing-dependent
- **Slow Iteration:** Each test requires deploying to devices, coordinating timing, and analyzing logs
- **Expensive:** Room full of devices costs $$$

This simulator lets you:
- âœ… Test complex multi-device scenarios on your laptop
- âœ… Reproduce edge cases deterministically with test scenarios
- âœ… Convert real app logs into replayable test cases
- âœ… Iterate rapidly without deploying to devices

## Architecture

### Packages
- **`swift/`** - iOS CoreBluetooth API simulation
  - `CBCentralManager` - Scanning and connecting to peripherals
  - `CBPeripheral` - Peripheral device representation with read/write capabilities
  - Delegate pattern matching iOS conventions

- **`kotlin/`** - Android Bluetooth API simulation
  - `BluetoothManager` / `BluetoothAdapter` - Android BLE stack
  - `BluetoothLeScanner` - Device discovery
  - `BluetoothDevice` / `BluetoothGatt` - GATT client for connections and data transfer
  - Callback pattern matching Android conventions

- **`wire/`** - Filesystem-based communication layer
  - Each device gets a UUID and directory (`data/{uuid}/`)
  - `inbox/` and `outbox/` subdirectories for message passing
  - `advertising.json` - BLE advertising data (service UUIDs, device name, TX power)
  - `gatt.json` - GATT table (services and characteristics)
  - Discovery works by scanning for other UUID directories
  - Data transfer via JSON message files

### Current Capabilities

âœ… Device discovery with advertising data (service UUIDs, device name, manufacturer data)

âœ… Connection establishment (both directions)

âœ… GATT service and characteristic discovery

âœ… Data transmission (write characteristic)

âœ… Data reception (read characteristic with polling)

âœ… **Test scenario framework** for edge case reproduction

âœ… **Log parser** to convert mobile app logs into test scenarios

âœ… Clean logging with platform prefixes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run basic iOS â†” Android communication
go run main.go

# Output shows advertising data and message exchange:
# [iOS] Discovered Android device: Samsung Galaxy Test
# [iOS]   - Service UUIDs: [E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F]
# [iOS] Connected to Android device
# [Android] ðŸ“¤ SENT: "hi from Android"
# [iOS] ðŸ“© RECEIVED: "hi from Android"
```

## Testing Edge Cases

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed documentation on edge cases and scenarios.

### Built-In Test Scenarios

1. **Photo Send Collision** (`scenarios/photo_collision.json`) - Two devices send simultaneously, tie-breaker resolves
2. **Stale Handshake** (`scenarios/stale_handshake.json`) - Handshake >60s triggers reconnection
3. **Multi-Device Room** (`scenarios/multi_device_room.json`) - 5 devices with connection arbitration

### Converting Real Logs to Scenarios

Extract edge cases from your mobile app logs:

```bash
# Parse iOS and Android logs into a test scenario
go run cmd/log2scenario/main.go \
  --ios path/to/ios.log \
  --android path/to/android.log \
  --output scenarios/my_edge_case.json

# Replay it
go run cmd/replay/main.go --scenario scenarios/my_edge_case.json
```

## Real Platform Integration

The simulator uses UUIDs and APIs matching the real Aura app in `../../dev/hme-ios/AuraPhone/` and `../../dev/hme-android/`:

### Service UUIDs
```go
const (
    AuraServiceUUID      = "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F"  // QR Osmosis Service
    AuraTextCharUUID     = "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5D"  // Handshake messages (protobuf)
    AuraPhotoCharUUID    = "E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5E"  // Photo transfer
)
```
