# Wire Package - Next Steps

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete GATT Discovery (Client-Side API)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] Add public `DiscoverServices(peerUUID string)` method to Wire
- [x] Add public `DiscoverCharacteristics(peerUUID string, serviceUUID []byte)` method
- [x] Add public `DiscoverDescriptors(peerUUID string, charHandle uint16)` method
- [x] Replace temporary hash-based UUID-to-handle mapping with discovery cache lookups
- [x] Add realistic delays (100-500ms per discovery operation)
- [x] Create integration test for full discovery flow

**Why**: Completes the discovery implementation, enables real usage of discovery protocol

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 2. Multiple Simultaneous Connections
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [ ] Test multiple connections to the same device
- [ ] Verify per-connection state isolation (MTU, discovery cache, request tracker)
- [ ] Add tests for concurrent discovery on multiple connections
- [ ] Test connection limits (iOS typically 7-10, Android varies)

**Why**: Critical for realistic BLE scenarios, many apps connect to multiple peripherals

---

### 3. CCCD Writes (Subscriptions)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort**: Small

- [ ] Implement CCCD write handling (0x2902 descriptor)
- [ ] Enable/disable notifications via CCCD writes
- [ ] Track subscription state per connection
- [ ] Add tests for subscribe/unsubscribe flow

**Why**: Required for notifications/indications to work properly

## üîÆ Future Work

### Physical Layer Simulation
- Add realistic latency based on connection parameters
- Simulate radio propagation delays
- Implement connection interval timing

### Link Layer Control PDUs
- Connection update requests (LL_CONNECTION_UPDATE_IND)
- Channel map updates
- Feature exchange

### Advanced Features
- Bonding/pairing simulation
- Security Manager Protocol (SMP)
- L2CAP Credit-Based Channels
- Multiple advertising sets

## üìù Known Limitations to Address

1. **UUID-to-handle mapping**: Still uses hash-based temporary approach
2. **Execute Write**: Doesn't deliver reassembled data to GATT handler yet
3. **Discovery cache**: Service tracking needs refinement (parent service association)
4. **No CCCD support**: Subscriptions not yet implemented

## üöÄ Success Criteria

Before moving to kotlin/ and swift/ integration:

- ‚úÖ Binary L2CAP + ATT communication working
- ‚úÖ MTU negotiation and enforcement
- ‚úÖ GATT discovery protocol (server-side)
- ‚úÖ GATT discovery protocol (client-side API)
- ‚è≥ Multiple simultaneous connections
- ‚è≥ CCCD writes for subscriptions
- ‚è≥ All tests passing with realistic scenarios
